    "Python is a modern, high-level programming language with many possible applications, including processing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.  Python and R are two of the most popular languages for data analysis.  While both applications can perform many of the same tasks, Python is commonly considered a general-purpose programming language, where R was developed specifically for statistical analysis.  However, as open source languages, users and programmers continually develop packages to address the weaknesses of both R and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the strengths of Python are its flexibility, easy-to-share notebooks, and readability (thus shorter learning curve!).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are trying to decide where to invest your coding efforts, you can find many discussions on the internet that might help you decide if R or Python is likely to be more useful to you.  The DataCamp website has a nice comparison here, https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis#gs.TUFrz28.\n",

    "\n",
    "Though there are many ways to use Python, today we will focus on Jupyter notebooks.  Notebooks provide a graphical interface, as oposed to the command line interface providing a user-friendly option for writing, debugging, and running code.  Jupyter notebooks, accessible via Anaconda Navigator, operate in your browser and allow you to include in-line results and outputs as well as formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is implemented for many different tasks, but in this workshop, we will cover on key aspects of handling and analyzing data.  There are many Python tutorials online, which can provide more comprehensive instructions.  \n",

    "* To manage cells, use the **Cell** menu located along the top of your screen\n",
    "* There are different types of cells-- you will need Markdown for text and code cells for code \n",
    "* There are several ways to run code\n",
    "    + use control + enter (Mac) or CTRL + enter (Windows) to run a cell\n",
    "    + use **shift + enter** to run a cell and select the next cell\n",
    "* Note that the **Help** menu includes a User Interface Tour as well as a comprehensive guide to keyboard shortcuts\n",
